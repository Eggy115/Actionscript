# ActionScript

This repository contains a collection of examples and demos for working with ActionScript, a programming language used primarily for creating rich media content and applications on the Adobe Flash Platform.

## Getting Started

To get started with these examples, you'll need to have the Adobe Flash Player installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the Adobe website [here](https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/).

Once you have Flash Player installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine and open the  `.swf` files in the `bin` directory with your web browser or a standalone Flash Player application.

Each example includes source code and a compiled .swf file in the `bin` directory.
